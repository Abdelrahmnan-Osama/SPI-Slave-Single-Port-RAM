# SPI-Slave-Single-Port-RAM
Designed and implemented an SPI Slave interface for efficient communication between a processor and single.-port RAM on an Artix-7 FPGA. This project features a state machine to manage SPI operations and integrates a custom-developed single-port RAM module. Tools used include Verilog, Xilinx Vivado, and QuestaSim
